**Dr. Wenzhao Liang** <img style="float: left; padding-right: 15px;" src="/images/liangwenzhao.jpg" width="200"> 
<br>
Postdoc (2022-now) **[CV](https://hkustDingHe.github.io/files/WenzhaoLiangCV.pdf)**
<br/><br/>
Dr. Liang holds a PhD degree in Hydrogeology and Biogeochemistry from The University of Hong Kong. His research primarily revolves around unraveling the intricate interplay among physical, biogeochemical, and environmental processes in coastal environments. Currently, his focus lies in the carbon cycle, with a particular interest in exploring the connection between the characteristics of dissolved organic matter and greenhouse gas dynamics. Additionally, Liang is actively engaged in utilizing machine learning techniques to evaluate the impact of environmental drivers on hydro-
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;bio-geo-chemical processes.

<br>
Postdoc (2022-now)
<br/><br/>
Zhaoliang got his Ph.D. in Biology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022. His current research mainly focuses on understanding carbon cycling in coastal wetlands and estuaries by 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;using FT-ICR MS and 3D-EEMs fluorescence spectrometer. He is also interested in investigating 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;the biogeochemical impact of microplastics on coastal carbon cycling.

<br>
PhD student (2022-now)
<br/><br/>
Zhenwei obtained his Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the Ocean University of China. His research is centered around the use of stable nitrogen isotopes and high-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate the fate of dissolved organic nitrogen in marine environments. The objective of his study is to gain a deeper understanding of the role of dissolved organic nitrogen in marine nitrogen and carbon cycles, as well as its implications for global change.
