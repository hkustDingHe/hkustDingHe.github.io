Assessing the ecological impacts of anthropogenic activities on the coastal wetlands in Hong Kong from the optical properties of sedimentary dissolved organic matter.<br/>
This project aims to assess the ecological impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage, fuel oil, and microplastic pollution) on the sediments of Hong Kong coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves, seagrass meadows, and tidal flats), by monitoring the optical and biochemical properties of sedimentary dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal wetlands. Using the most advanced and rapid fluorescence spectrometer, the study will trace the source of DOM—an indicator of ecosystem health—in the sediment. In addition, by combining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, chemical and physical bulk properties of DOM and the socio-economic parameters, the ecological impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage, fuel oil and microplastic pollution) on the sediments in the coastal wetlands of Hong Kong will be also evaluated. The results will provide a theoretical basis for predicting and regulating the material cycle in the coastal wetlands, as well as formulating policy on the conservation and management of the Hong Kong coastal wetland ecosystem.<br/>
<b>Objectives of the Project</b>
Hong Kong has a long coastline supporting a variety of coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves, seagrass meadows, and tidal flats). These coastal wetlands provide multiple functions, such as sustained biodiversity, fisheries nursing, shoreline protection, tourism and education. Under the background of global warming and national carbon peak and carbon neutral policies, coastal wetlands are also considered as a natural way to sequestrate carbon. Although they occupy only 0.5% of the global seafloor area, they fix ~50% of the global oceanic carbon. Therefore, the conservation of coastal wetlands is very important.<br/>
As an international metropolis, Hong Kong has frequent human activities and urban construction, which likely affect the environment of coastal wetlands significantly, especially the composition of organic matter in sediments. Sewage, microplastics, and even fuel oil pollution can all affect the health of coastal wetlands. However, it is challenging to assess how these anthropogenic activities affect the environment and nutrient cycle of coastal wetlands. This has hindered the efforts of government, academia, and industry in coastal wetland conservation. Therefore, scientific research is needed to develop a rapid and efficient diagnostic approach. This will not only provide insight into the differences in organic composition across coastal wetlands, but also offer an opportunity to trace the source of anthropogenic organic pollution.
