Assessing the ecological impacts of anthropogenic activities on the coastal wetlands in Hong Kong from the optical properties of sedimentary dissolved organic matter.
This project aims to assess the ecological impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage, fuel oil, and microplastic pollution) on the sediments of Hong Kong coastal wetlands (e.g., mangroves, seagrass meadows, and tidal flats), by monitoring the optical and biochemical properties of sedimentary dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the coastal wetlands. Using the most advanced and rapid fluorescence spectrometer, the study will trace the source of DOM—an indicator of ecosystem health—in the sediment. In addition, by combining the carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, chemical and physical bulk properties of DOM and the socio-economic parameters, the ecological impact of anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage, fuel oil and microplastic pollution) on the sediments in the coastal wetlands of Hong Kong will be also evaluated. The results will provide a theoretical basis for predicting and regulating the material cycle in the coastal wetlands, as well as formulating policy on the conservation and management of the Hong Kong coastal wetland ecosystem
